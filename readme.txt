=> The ChucK Live Coding Adventures of Scott Hewitt

Within this git repo and via some audio and video I will capture my solo ChucK live coding practice.

Others are welcome to join in and modify code as they wish, though in doing so you have to except that others may also use your code, in fact this is a place to share code and create the release I wish.

Please feel free to comment @scotthewitt, scotthewitt.co.uk.
